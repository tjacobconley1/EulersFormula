# EULER's FORMULA
# Author: Tyler Conley

import numpy as np
import matplotlib

# Formula:
#            e^ix = cos(x) + i*sin(x)
#    where 'e' = 2.718...  (the base of the natural logarithm)
#          'x' = to degrees of rotation (in pi or radians?)
#      and 'i' = an imaginary number (sqrt( a negative number )

# written:
#            F + V = E + 2
#
#    where 'F' is the number of faces,
#          'V' is the number of verticies
#      and 'E' is the number of edges
#
#







# when x = pi or 2 pi Euler's equation yields two simultaneous expressions
#
#          e^(i(pi)) = -1        and         e^(2i(pi)) = 1
